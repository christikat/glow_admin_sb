# Fivem Admin Scoreboard With Discord Integration For QBCore

A script that allows admins to quickly view player's character info and discord roles. Discord info will only display for players that have joined your discord server and have their discord connected to FiveM.

This script also has search and filter functionality for admins to quickly find specific players. In the top right of the scoreboard there are counters that display how many admins are online, and total player count. In the config file, you can also add jobs to display as a counter. By clicking on the counter, you will filter out all player's that aren't apart of that category.

You can view a players inventory by clicking on their profile picture.
